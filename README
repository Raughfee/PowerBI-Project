This project basically aims to provide comprehensive analytics and insights for the hospitality industry. I analyze various aspects of their operations and make data-driven decisions to enhance guest experience, optimize resources, and improve overall performance. 25+ Dax measures have been used to make things meaningful. Ex, Occupancy and Revenue Analysis, average Daily rate (ADR), Realisation percentages, cancellation percentages, Booking by Platforms and a lot more  Dax measures.
